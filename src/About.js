			<p>I am a junior Web Developer and I have a particular love for JavaScript (JS) and React, it's the reason why I built this website with React.js. If you ask me where I see myself in five years, I will answer as a full stack Web Developer who is always up to date on new tech. I am also interested in AI and data science, so being very confident with R, Python, Java, Scala and SQL will be a dream come true for me.</p>
