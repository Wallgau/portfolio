			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>I am a junior Web Developper who have a particular love for JS and React,
					it's the reason why I build this website with React.js.
					If you ask me where I see myself in 5 years,
					I will answer as full stack Web Developper, always on page with new Tech.
                I am also interested by AI and dataScience so being very confident with python, php and C will be a dream comes true for me.</p>
